# Fact_verification

This repository contains a BERT model fine-tuned for claim verification on a claim verfication dataset found in Bert_for_sequence.ipynb.

Claim verification is the task of determining the truthfulness of a given claim or statement. In the era of fake news and misinformation, this is an important application of natural language processing (NLP) models. This BERT model aims to classify claims into three categories: True, False, or Unverified. It has been trained and fine-tuned on a labeled dataset to make these classifications.

Dataset
The model is trained on a carefully curated dataset that contains claims and corresponding labels. The labels indicate whether the claims are True, False, or Unverified. The dataset is available for training and evaluation purposes.
